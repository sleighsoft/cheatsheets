# Testing

## Testing a Real World Object

1. Who will use it? And why?
2. What are the use cases?
3. What are the bounds of use?
4. What are the stress / failure conditions?
5. How would you perform the testing?

## Testing a Piece of Software

1. Type of testing
   - Black Box
   - White Box
2. Who will use it? And why?
3. What are the use cases?
4. What are the bounds of use?
5. What are the stress / failure conditions?
   - How does failure look like? 
6. What are the test cases? How would you perform the testing?
   - What exact situations?
   - Which steps can be automated?
   - Which require human intervention?

## Generalized

1. Type of test?
2. User of tested object?
3. Bounds of usage?
4. Failure conditions?
5. How/what to test?

## Testing a Function

1. Types of test cases
   - Normal case
     - even/odd length
   - Extremes
     - empty array
   - Nulls & illegal input
     - negative input
   - Strange input
     - already sorted
2. Expected result
   - Right output
   - Returns a copy
3. Implement
